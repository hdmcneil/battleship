Written reflection:

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We started ny building the code. We initally ran rspec to resolve errors. Once rspec did not return any errors we played the game to find where it was not functioning as desired.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

  We would work on writing more tests and we would attempt to turn our game into a gem that could be downloaded.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

 We applied the Driver/Navigator techniques and incorporated Ping Pong, which we found highly effective in enhancing our GitHub collaboration skills.


4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

We shared feedback during huddles and over slack.
